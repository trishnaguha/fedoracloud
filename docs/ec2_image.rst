Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2)
==================================

Fedora's EC2 images follow the standard EC2 login conventions, meaning that root login is disabled, but sudo access is granted.

**The default username for the images is ec2-user**

Full documentation for interacting with EC2 is available from `Amazon Web Services <http://docs.amazonwebservices.com/AWSEC2/latest/GettingStartedGuide/>`_.
